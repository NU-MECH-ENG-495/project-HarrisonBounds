# RViz Motion Planner Proposal

## Overview

This document outlines a proposal for developing a simple motion planner that integrates with RViz in ROS2. The planner will allow users to visualize and simulate robot paths in RViz while providing a straightforward C++ implementation that follows ROS2 best practices.

## Project Goals

1. Create a modular motion planning system for ROS2
2. Provide visualization of planned paths in RViz
3. Implement simple obstacle avoidance algorithms
4. Create a user-friendly interface for setting goals and parameters

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Motion Planning Node**
   - Receives goal poses from RViz or other sources
   - Implements path planning algorithms
   - Publishes planned paths for visualization and execution

2. **RViz Integration**
   - Custom RViz plugin for goal selection
   - Path visualization using Marker/MarkerArray messages
   - Robot state visualization

3. **Obstacle Detection**
   - Process sensor data (laser scan, point cloud)
   - Create occupancy grid or costmap
   - Update planning scene

4. **Path Execution**
   - Convert planned path to velocity commands
   - Monitor execution and handle replanning
