# Project Proposal for C++

For my project, I wanted to implement code on a physical system, since my major is currently Robotics. I decided I wanted to use the Unitree Robot dogs we have in our lab to navigate a space using path finding algorithms. Many pathfinding algorithms work well in static environments, but real-world scenarios often involve dynamic obstacles (e.g., moving objects, people, or other robots). My goal is to implement a pathfinding/ exploring algorithm on the robot dog for it to successfully navigate an area in 3d. 

The first step towards this goal is interfacing with the Unitree dog's software development kit (SDK) and to understand the existing code base in order to understand what makes the dog move, what sensors the dog has, etc. The SDK is available on a GitHub repo owned by Unitree, and is public for anyone to clone.
